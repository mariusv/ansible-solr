Ansible playbook to install and configure Solr(4.7.1) + Jetty for Drupal

For now this was tested only on .deb (Ubuntu, Debian) but I already wrote the role for .rpm distro but not yet tested.
Also this assumes that Drupal is installed on a separate server.


ToDo:
 - Sanitize the code
 - Test the .rpm role
 - Add Drupal installation
 - Secure the Jetty instance (firewall)
 - Better README :-)
